# Hell Let Loose Auto Join
Program that keeps trying to join a server because its annoying to do it manually for 20 minutes at 9pm.

There are 2 versions of the program:
1. Color Matching - uses pixel() to compare pixel color and then clicks, it is safe to leave unattended but it might not work on newer version of python.

2. Just Clicking - script that just clicks on specific pixel, it is not safe to leave unattended, because when joined to a server, script will automatically join team. It should be working on newer version of python.

Some other important info: 

Hell Let Loose has to be full screen or borderless for autoclick to work.

Select the server that you want to join and choose correct resolution.

When you select the resolution there will be a 10s delay before the program begins for users that have only one monitor.

Hold button 'p' on keyboard for a few seconds to stop the program.


This program uses two libraries that you need to download (requirements.txt).
