# Hell Let Loose Auto Join
Program that keeps trying to join a server because its annoying to do it manually for 20 minutes at 9pm 


Hell Let Loose has to be full screen or borderless for autoclick to work

Select the server that you want to join and choose correct resolution

When you select the resolution there will be a 10s delay before the program begins for users that have only one monitor

Hold button 'p' for a few seconds to stop the program


This program uses two libraries that you need to download (requirements.txt)
